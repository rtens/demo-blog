<p>I've been working on my Web Application TOol Kit (short <em>watoki</em>) for a while now and thought if I ever want
    anybody besides me to use it, I better write a tutorial.</p>

<p><em>watoki</em> is not a framework but a collection of libraries that provide common infrasctructure for web
    applications. The goal of each library is to be as lightweight as possible and making it easy for the client code to
    stay independent of the infrasctructure. Check out all the library <a href="http://github.com/watoki">here</a>.</p>

<p>So here we go. Let's build a ... (drumm roll) ... <em>blog</em> application (because nobody has ever done that).</p>

<p>You find the complete code of this application on <a href="https://github.com/rtens/watoki-demo">github</a>. Some
    section titles link to the commit that contains the code changes of the sections.</p>

<h2>Starting Small</h2>

<p>Since we are all hip and lean and agile, let's build an MVP version (Minimal Viable Product, <em>not</em> Most
    Valuable Player) of our blog. Here is the entire directory structure:</p>

<p>... I'm gonna stop here. But you can read the whole article in <a
