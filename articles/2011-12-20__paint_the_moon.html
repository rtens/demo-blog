<h1>Paint the moon</h1>
<h4>Thu 20 December 2011</h4>

<p>I think the moon should be painted red. Here is why:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I never liked the current color of the moon</li>
    <li>It's sometimes too bright and doesn't let me sleep</li>
    <li>I really really really like the color red</li>
</ul>
